# Week-01 Intro, test, test driven design Maven, Continuous Integration + JavaScript intro

## Business competences
#### Test, Maven and CI
History has proven that the task of designing quality software is not an easy task
Knowing how and when to test software is one way of ensuring quality in software and is a skill in high demand on the job-market (ref: https://www.jobindex.dk/jobsoegning/it?q=tester)
#### JavaScript
JavaScript is one of the most demanded programming skills. [ref: it.jobindex.dk](https://it.jobindex.dk/jobsoegning?q=javascript&supid=1)
JavaScript this semester will provide students with the background to join modern front-end teams, using JS and supplementing JS frameworks/libraries.
